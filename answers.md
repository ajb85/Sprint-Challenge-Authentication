#What is the purpose of using sessions? _To persist data across requests, to "fake state"_

#What does bcrypt do to help us store passwords in a secure manner. _It hashes passwords with a salt (one way process) to scramble passwords and make it more difficult to crack them. The only reliable way to get the password from there is with a rainbow table._

#What does bcrypt do to slow down attackers? _Add time complexity with further iterations. The longer it takes to get to the hash, the longer it'll take to crack_

#What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token? _Header, payload, signature_
